You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /media/sf_git_repositories/website

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are currently outside your home directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info] 
[debug] >>> HTTP REQUEST GET https://admin.firebase.com/v1/projects 
[debug] <<< HTTP RESPONSE 200
[info] 
=== Database Setup
[info] 
[info] Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
[info] structured and when your data can be read from and written to.
[info] 
[debug] >>> HTTP REQUEST GET https://wmvecon.firebaseio.com/.settings/rules.json 
[debug] <<< HTTP RESPONSE 200
[info] ✔  Database Rules for wmvecon have been downloaded to database.rules.json.
[info] Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run
[info] firebase deploy.
[info] 
=== Hosting Setup
[info] 
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
[info]

[info] 
[info] i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
[info] i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...
[info] 
[info] ✔  Firebase initialization complete!
