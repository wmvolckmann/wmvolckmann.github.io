## News

The final exam summary can be found [here](finalsummary.pdf). Same disclaimer
as before. (I've already had to fix one typo. Because I can prove that the
real numbers are uncountably infinite off the top of my head, but I mess up the
difference between left and right. Go figure.)

The midterm 2 summary can be found [here](midterm2summary.pdf). Same disclaimer
as before.

The midterm 1 summary can be found [here](midterm1summary.pdf). Disclaimer:
these are things that I gather you should be *completely* familiar with, but it
is not necessarily an exhaustive summary of what you will need to know (since I
cannot squeeze every single lecture and every single homework problem on one page).

## Course Information

The syllabus can be read [here](f2016syllabus.pdf). The synopsis:

### Lecture

* Instructor: Emanuel A. Frenkel (eafrenkel at ucdavis.edu)
* Time and Place: Tuesday, Thursday 3:10–4:30pm, 1002 Giedt Hall
* Office Hours: Tuesday/Thursday 1:30–2:30pm & by appointment, SSH 145
* Textbook: N. Gregory Mankiw, Macroeconomics, 7th, 8th, or 9th Edition
* Midterm 1: Tuesday, October 18
* Midterm 2: Tuesday, November 15
* Final Exam: Wednesday, December 7 at 1:00pm

### Discussion
* Me: William M Volckmann II (wmvolckmann at ucdavis.edu)
* Sections: Monday 6:10-7:00pm & 7:10-8:00pm, Bainer Hall 1130
* Office Hours: Monday 1:00-3:00pm, 116 SSH

Note that 116 SSH is where I hold my TA office hours, but it's not my actual
office. So if you go there at some other time hoping to find me, chances are
you'll find someone who is distinctly not me. Shoot me an email if you need to
get a hold of me outside of Monday 1-3.

### Contact

On a busyness scale from 1-10, I'm at about 10-$$\epsilon$$, so I might
not be able to respond to emails as timely as I'd like. And I probably won't be
answering emails that come after 10pm or so until the next day. That said, I will
try to be expeditious in answering them.
