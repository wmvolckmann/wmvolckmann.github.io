title: The Decline in Video Game Quality Over Time
exclude: true
---

Using Metascores and user scores from 2000 through 2021, both of which are allowed to range from 0 to 100, I measure the (perceived) quality of novel gaming in the following ways.[^1]

First, I focus on the 75th percentile of scores in each quarter of each year. For example, if the 75th percentile is 80, then 25 percent of games released in that quarter had a score of 80 or above. This implicitly assumes that the quality of a platform's ecosystem can be defined by the quality of its top-shelf games; bad games can just be ignored.

Percentile measures quality in proportional terms, but one might argue that the absolute number of high-quality games is more important in determining the quality of a platform's ecosystem. To that end, I also count the number of games released in each quarter of each year with a score above 80.

I look at PC as well as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo consoles. I consider the console manufacturers to each provide a single ecosystem; when a manufacturer has two consoles simultaneously receiving new releases, I simply aggregate the two as if they constitute a single console. This is partly for simplicity, and partly to express each manufacturer as a single ecosystem so as to measure the overall quality of that ecosystem.

 To account for review bombing, I omit user scores that differ from their respective Metascores by 30 or more points. This reduces the number of user scores in the sample of PC games from 4915 to 4749, of Playstation games from 4894 to 4785, of Nintendo games from 2794 to 2743, and of Xbox games from 3641 to 3514.

### PC Video Game Quality Trend ###
There is broad agreement among professional reviewers and users when it comes to the decline quality of top-shelf PC games, although the decline is steeper when looking at user scores. There has been a decline of about 1.5 Metascore over the last 20 years according to professional reviewers, and a decline of about 4 points according to users.[^2]

There is mild disagreement between professional reviewers and users when it comes to the number of top-shelf PC games being released. According to professional reviewers, the number of top-shelf PC games being released has increased, nearly doubling over the last 20 years, whereas there has been no change according to users.[^3]

[^3]: p < 0.001 and p = 0.553, respectively

### Playstation Video Game Quality Trend ###
The overall quality of top-shelf Playstation games shows no trend according to professional reviewers, but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of around 13 points over the last 20 years.[^4] Likewise, the number of top-shelf Playstation games shows no trend according to professional reviewers, but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of about 18 top-shelf games being released per quarter.[^5]

[^4]: p = 0.376 and p < 0.001, respectively
[^5]: p = 0.214 and p < 0.001, respectively

### Nintendo Video Game Quality Trend ###
The overall quality of top-shelf Nintendo games shows no trend according to professional reviewers, but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of around 3 points over the last 20 years.[^6] On the other hand, the number of top-shelf Nintendo games trends upwards according to both professional reviewers and users by about 12 games and 8 games per quarter, respectively.[^7]

[^6]: p = 0.738 and p < 0.001, respectively
[^7]: p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively

### Xbox Video Game Quality Trend ###
The overall quality of top-shelf Xbox games shows no trend according to professional reviewers, but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of around 9 points over the last 20 years.[^8] Likewise, the number of top-shelf Xbox games shows no trend according to professional reviewers, but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of about 12 top-shelf games being released per quarter.[^9]

[^8]: p = 0.456 and p < 0.001, respectively
[^9]: p = 0.260 and p < 0.001, respectively

### Overall Video Game Quality Trend ###
The overall quality of top-shelf games shows no trend according to professional reviewers; but has a steep downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of around 7 points over the last 20 years.[^10] The number of top-shelf games has an upward trend according to professional reviewers, accumulating to an increase of around 29 top-shelf games being released per quarter; but there is a downward trend according to users, accumulating to a decline of about 16 top-shelf games being released per quarter.[^11]

[^10]: p = 0.217 and p < 0.001, respectively
[^11]: p = 0.360 and p = 0.024, respectively

### Conclusions ###
Professional reviewers seem to be more charitable in their assessments over time compared to users, often to a degree that casts doubt upon the relevance of professional reviewers as sources of useful information for gamers in general. PC as an ecosystem seems to be holding fairly steady as far as quality is concerned, whereas Playstation and Xbox seem to be struggling, and Nintendo seems to be thriving (especially thanks to the success of the Switch).
