<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúJohn Bardeen won two Nobel Prizes in physics, and all who write about Bardeen remember him as a quiet and modest person. His hobby was golf, and many years after his second prize his long-time golf partner asked him, ‚ÄòJust what is it you do for a living‚Äô? Apparently Bardeen had never worked the two Nobel Prizes into conversations with his golf partner.‚Äù Hargittai, Istv√°n. <em>The road to Stockholm: Nobel Prizes, science, and scientists.</em> OUP Oxford, 2002.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúIt is not hard to demonstrate that all the main threats confronting the world today, from atomic war and ecological disaster to a catastrophic collapse of society and civilization ‚Äî by which I mean the widening gulf between rich and poor individuals and nations ‚Äî have hidden deep within them a single root cause: the imperceptible transformation of what was originally a humble message into an arrogant one.‚Äù V√°clav Havel</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThe angel who demands heroism not only of himself but of others, who denies the value of compromise, who perceives the world with a Manichean simplicity and despises those who have a different concept of obligation towards others ‚Äì this angel, loving heaven as he may, has already started on the path that leads to hell.‚Äù Adam Michnik</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself ‚Äî and you are the easiest person to fool.‚Äù Richard Feynman</li>
