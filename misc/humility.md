“John Bardeen won two Nobel Prizes in physics, and all who write about Bardeen remember him as a quiet and modest person. His hobby was golf, and many years after his second prize his long-time golf partner asked him, ‘Just what is it you do for a living’? Apparently Bardeen had never worked the two Nobel Prizes into conversations with his golf partner.” Hargittai, István. *The road to Stockholm: Nobel Prizes, science, and scientists.* OUP Oxford, 2002.
