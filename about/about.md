<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JAVASCRIPT">

  var r_text = new Array ();

  r_text[0] = "The most complicated people always want the simplest things. What makes them complicated is the difficulty they face in getting those simple things.";

  r_text[1] = "Sometimes things you like are wrong. Sometimes things you dislike like are right. Sometimes people you like are wrong. Sometimes people you dislike are right.";

  r_text[2] = "There is always someone smarter than you; more educated than you; and better intentioned than you; who has come to a different conclusion than you.";

  r_text[3] = "Science works because it demands skepticism of its own results.";

  r_text[4] = "Appeals to authority are always invalid. Just as with ad hominem, a statement for or against a position is neither weaker nor stronger depending on who is making the argument. As a corollary, offering no argument and simply highlighting the source of an assertion is equivalent to making no argument. The whole point of science (and the motivation behind Enlightenment principles more generally) is to let the merits of logic, reason, and evidence do the talking, usurping the primacy of source.";

  r_text[5] = "When raison d'être is having problem to solve, what does that make the solution?"

  r_text[6] = "I never worry about whether someone agrees with me or not. I do worry about whether someone will hate me for not agreeing with them."

  r_text[7] = "It is okay — admirable, in fact — to be skeptical of conventional wisdom, mainstream narratives, and traditional institutions. It is not wrong to reject them sometimes. The challenge is in finding a tenable substitute, and not credulously plugging in whatever alternative sounds the most appealing. The problem with most radical policy proposals and conspiracy theories is that the same dose of skepticism that lead to a rejection of the status quo would typically lead to an even more aggressive rejection of the proposed alternative. After all, it is not possible to be selectively skeptical: you are either skeptical or gullible, and being gullible for alternatives is far from virtuous."

  r_text[8] = "A person does not believe in democracy unless they defend it even when they don't want to. A person does not believe in free speech unless they defend it even when they don't want to. A person does not believe in due process unless they defend it even when they don't want to. That is why such ideals, despite being the greatest of social innovations, took so long to emerge and fall so easily."

  r_text[9] = "The more inclined we are to believe something, the more skeptical of it we should be. Our minds are tapestries of biases that cloud our judgement, and failing to actively counteract them is tantamount to submitting to them."

  r_text[10] = "A quick way to see if someone respects you or not is to disagree with them about something important. Only if they respect you will they accept (or at a bare minimum, tolerate) your disagreement. If your disagreement is met with antagonism, then they do not respect you: they only respect themselves, and therefore are not worthy of your own respect."

  r_text[11] = "Morals and values, being social constructs, cannot be debated in the same way that objective issues can. Rather, the persuasive power of morals and values is mostly derived from the character of those who hold such morals and values. Ergo being a decent person and behaving in a respectable way (as characterized according to the general values of one's society) is the most effective way to advertise and propagate one's own morals and values; and being an antagonistic person, behaving in a destructive way, the least."

  r_text[12] = "We should all thank and celebrate goodness and decency in the world when we see it. Even ordinary, every day goodness and decency have much value. But it is not enough to merely expect goodness and decency from people, because merely expecting something is, in practical terms, indistinguishable from assigning it zero value. And you can't expect something if you aren't even willing to assign it value."

  r_text[13] = "A major problem with tribalism is the way criticism is addressed. A tribe is unlikely to take seriously criticisms that come from another tribe, even if those criticisms have merit. Any self-correcting mechanism, then, must come from within the tribe itself. To that end, one should always be willing and eager to criticize the flaws and excesses of one's own tribe. Failure to do so not only allows the tribe's weaknesses to flourish, but also lessens pressure on other tribes to get their own acts together: everyone loses."

  var i = Math.floor(r_text.length * Math.random());

  document.write(r_text[i]);
