### Discussion
* Me: William M Volckmann II (wmvolckmann at ucdavis.edu)
* Sections: Monday 3:10-4pm & 4:10-5pm, Hoagland Hall 113
* Sections: Monday 5:10-6pm & 6:10-7pm, Olson Hall 141
* Office Hours: Thursday 2-4pm, 118 SSH

Note that 118 SSH is where I hold my TA office hours (and is an awful, awful
  room -- I apologize for that), but it's not my actual office. So if you go there at
  some other time hoping to find me, chances are
  you'll find someone who is distinctly not me.


### Contact

On a busyness scale from 1-10, I'm at about 10-$$\epsilon$$, so I might not be
 able to respond to emails as timely as I'd like. And I probably won't be
 answering emails that come after 10pm or so until the next day. That said, I
 will try to be expeditious in answering them. Note that you can also post
 things on the Canvas discussion board.
