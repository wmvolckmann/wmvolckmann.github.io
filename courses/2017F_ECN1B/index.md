### Discussion
* Me: William M Volckmann II (wmvolckmann at ucdavis.edu)
* Office Hours: Monday 12-2pm, 116 SSH
* Sections: Tuesday
  * 5:10-6pm, Olson Hall 217

  * 7:10-8pm, Olson Hall 163
  * 8:10-9pm, Olson Hall 163

Note that 116 SSH is where I hold my TA office hours, but it's not my actual
office. So if you go there at some other time hoping to find me, chances are
you'll find someone who is distinctly not me.


### Contact
On a busyness scale from 1-10, I'm at about 10-$$\epsilon$$, so I might not be
 able to respond to emails as timely as I'd like. And I probably won't be
 answering emails that come after 10pm or so until the next day.
