## News

The final exam summary can be found [here](finalsummary.pdf). Same disclaimer
as before. (I've already had to fix one typo. Because I can prove that the
real numbers are uncountably infinite off the top of my head, but I mess up the
difference between left and right. Go figure.)

The midterm 2 summary can be found [here](midterm2summary.pdf). Same disclaimer
as before.

The midterm 1 summary can be found [here](midterm1summary.pdf). Disclaimer:
these are things that I gather you should be *completely* familiar with, but it
is not necessarily an exhaustive summary of what you will need to know (since I
cannot squeeze every single lecture and every single homework problem on one page).
