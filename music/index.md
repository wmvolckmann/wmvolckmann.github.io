### [Album](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cbDCwiXI8SE_iE70ZQ1xxQBLRERes0n)
I tried recording an album in my bedroom, back when I was an undergrad. It's pretty okay. I would record new original music if I had more resources to do so (I still have so many unrecorded songs). Unfortunately, I only have exactly as many resources as I have.

### [Guitalele EP](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cbDCwiXI8Sz72KYoMlu_Q0NC-Cp3Xg9)
I tried recording an EP in my bedroom using an $80 guitalele and a portable podcasting microphone, back when I was a grad student. It's pretty okay.

### [Covers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cbDCwiXI8TOUe52ILU3udZQcn7AjG_q)
I also recorded a bunch of covers in my bedroom using a guitalele, back when I was a grad student. They're pretty okay.
