### Introduction ###
Using Metascores and user scores from 2000 through 2021, both of which are allowed to range from 0 to 100, I measure the extent to which the media is "out of touch" with the general public for four different types of entertainment media: video games, television shows, movies, and music albums. The "out of touch" measurement is taken to be the magnitude of difference between Metascores and users scores, on average, of media released each quarter of each year.


### Video Games ###
Around the year 2000, the gaming media are out of touch by about 8.7 points; and around the year 2020, the gaming media are out of touch by about 9.7 points. The upward trend in disagreement is about 0.012 points per quarter (p = 0.017). The increase in disagreement over time is likely driven by relatively harsher perceptions of users.[^1]

### Television Shows ###
There appears to be no long-term change in how out of touch the television media are (p = 0.669), with a mean disagreement of about 12.4 points. Around 2005 or so there seems to be a moment of extreme disagreement.

### Movies ###
Around the year 2000, the movie media are out of touch by about 18.4 points; and around the year 2020, the movie media are out of touch by about 9.9 points. The downward trend in disagreement is about -0.098 points per quarter (p < 0.001), or a closing of the gap of about 2 points every 5 years.

### Entertainment Media as a Whole ###
Around the year 2000, the entertainment media as a whole are out of touch by about 12.8 points; and around the year 2020, the entertainment media as a whole are out of touch by about 8.8 points. The downward trend in disagreement is about -0.046 points per quarter (p < 0.001), or a closing of the gap of about 1 point every 5-6 years.

### Conclusion ###
The entertainment media as a whole appears to be less out of touch today than it was 20 years ago. The effect is most pronounced in movies and music, whereas the video game media appear to be slightly more out of touch over time. In more recent years, the music media appears to be the least out of touch with an average disagreement of around 6 points, whereas the other media have average disagreements closer to 10 points.
