### Discussion
* Me: William M Volckmann II (wmvolckmann at ucdavis.edu)
* Sections: Monday 3:10-4pm & 4:10-5pm, Hoagland Hall 113

* Office Hours: Thursday 2-4pm, 118 SSH

Note that 118 SSH is where I hold my TA office hours, but it's not my actual
office. So if you go there at some other time hoping to find me, chances are
you'll find someone who is distinctly not me.


### Contact

On a busyness scale from 1-10, I'm at about 10-$$\epsilon$$, so I might
not be able to respond to emails as timely as I'd like. And I probably won't be
answering emails that come after 10pm or so until the next day. That said, I will
try to be expeditious in answering them.
