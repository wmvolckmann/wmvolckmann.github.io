### Dual Mandate

![Dual Mandate Performance](applied_GMtoToday_abs_individual.png)

I construct a performance index for the Federal Reserve apropos their dual mandate
with a five-year trailing moving average understanding of "medium term." The price
stability mandate is core PCE inflation with pre-2012 targets inferred by the
method of Ireland (2007). The unemployment mandate is assumed to be the natural
official unemployment rate as estimated by the CBO *Budget and Economic Outlook*.
