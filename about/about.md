Oh hi. My name is William Volckmann, and contrary to popular belief, *not*
William Volkman. In writing I often go by the much more pretentious *William M Volckmann II*,
but I'm actually not a blowhard -- it's just a habit you pick up when you are in a family
of multiple *William Volckmann*s. And on that note, you can call me whatever you want.

### Background

I'm from Wisconsin (mind the accent) and I earned my
bachelor of science degree from the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 2015,
having majored in economics and math. After doing some work for Paul Romer with NYU's
Marron Institute (on nothing economics related but I still feel the need to name-drop),
I made my way to Davis to start my PhD in economics.


### Personal

I've recorded a couple of albums under the name Wimivo. The material is mostly "okay"
with occasional flashes of "not bad." Feel free to listen if you are sufficiently bored.
They're on Spotify and the like, or you can just listen to them on Youtube with the
following links:

* [Wimivo - The Friend Zone](https://youtu.be/wHZVHMCTQn8?list=PL1cbDCwiXI8SfTc6Ru-xNbxz-On0EGgx_) (2016)
* [Wimivo - Don't Cry, Euphoria](https://youtu.be/LpcQloSq6Rs?list=PL1cbDCwiXI8QxI4T0Gn_ag4lU8STSPUvO) (2014)

And that's all I'm willing to write about because I already feel vain after having
written three short paragraphs about myself.
