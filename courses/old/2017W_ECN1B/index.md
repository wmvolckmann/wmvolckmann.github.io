Note that 118 SSH is where I hold my TA office hours (and is an awful, awful
  room, for which I apologize), but it's not my actual office. So if you go there at
  some other time hoping to find me, chances are
  you'll find someone who is distinctly not me.


### Contact

On a busyness scale from 1-10, I'm at about 10-$$\epsilon$$, so I might not be
 able to respond to emails as timely as I'd like. And I probably won't be
 answering emails that come after 10pm or so until the next day. That said, I
 will try to be expeditious in answering them. Note that you can also post
 things on the Canvas discussion board.
